        <p><font style ="font-famiyl:Arial;">Heart of givers organisation has once distributed school stationary to more than 17 school ever since it was founded since 2018. 
		A family once came through to us after their house was burnt down by natural disaster.We did fundraising and managed to raise money that built a house 
		for the family. However,as we are still facing the challenge of Corona Virus, some families are still struggling to
		have food on their table as they are currently not working because of the pandemic, we have 
		distributed food parcels to such families. Families that are over 14 in number.
